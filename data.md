# Setting up the data

Setting up the data can be a bit of an involved process. This document aims to provide a step-by-step procedure for setting the data up correctly.

## Getting started
The root directory for the data is `./data`. The three major portions of the dataset are as follows.
1. Full 450 image set of 3 LDR exposures w/ corresponding HDR exposure. Download from [here (~3Gb)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uMPYazkuA-zwRhXD8fJ34yMDN0cBgzWg?usp=sharing)
2. Precomputed HDR images generated by forward passing through a pretrianed HDRCNN model (see reference). Download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pjm-KZnZ7Do8WxV09RSHKGkjhknwXVVs?usp=sharing)
2. Precomputed HDR images for meta-test generated by forward passing through a pretrianed HDRCNN model (see reference). Download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NUWDIXyBGRvULOCFvcGlaRITT-5VPwx9?usp=sharing)

## Future Suggestions
- Provide bash script to automatically do this.
